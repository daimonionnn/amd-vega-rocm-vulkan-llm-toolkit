# `git fetch --depth 1 origin <short-sha>` — it fails with "couldn't find remote
# ref", and a build script that ignores that silently compiles whatever the
# checkout already had. That happened on 2026-09-08 and produced a build
# labelled as one commit but containing another.
# Bash pattern match, not `printf | grep -q`: under `set -o pipefail` the writer
# in that idiom can take SIGPIPE when grep exits on the first match and kill the
# whole script. It has done so four separate times in this repo. No subprocess
# is needed for a 40-character check.
