# amd-vega-rocm-vulkan-llm-toolkit for Linux 

Toolkit for ROCm and Vulkan LLM inference on Vega APUs/GPUs (tested on AMD Ryzen 5700G APU) + tools for multi-GPU LLM management (Vega + AMD/NVIDIA dGPUs) — llama.cpp (`llama-server`) and LM Studio.

## Hardware

| Component   | Detail                                                                    |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| CPU/APU     | AMD Ryzen 7 5700G (8C/16T, Zen 3) — undervolted: Curve Optimizer all-core offset **−15**; IOMMU disabled; CPU throttle limit raised to 99 °C (stock Tjmax is 95 °C) |
| iGPU        | Radeon Vega 8 — gfx90c (GCN 5, 8 CUs, **16 GB BIOS carve-out** + up to 64 GB UMA/GTT) — **the only GPU in the box as of September 2026** |
| dGPU        | none — both R9700s now live in a different machine (September 2026); `lspci` shows the Cezanne iGPU only. Benchmark rows dated May/June 2026 were recorded while they were still installed here |
| RAM         | 64 GB DDR4 — 2× 32 GB Kingston Fury 3600 MT/s, overclocked to 4200 MT/s (shared with the Vega 8 iGPU via UMA) |
| Motherboard | ASRock Fatal1ty B450 Gaming-ITX/ac                                        |
| OS          | Ubuntu 26.04.1 LTS "Resolute Raccoon", kernel 7.0                         |
| Host ROCm   | classic ROCm 7.2.0 from repo.radeon.com (noble/24.04 packages)             |

> **Why the RAM overclock matters:** on an APU the iGPU has no dedicated VRAM — all weights and KV cache live in UMA/GTT system RAM, so decode throughput is directly bound by DDR4 bandwidth (see [docs/ARCHITECTURE.md](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md)). All benchmark numbers in this repo were measured with this exact memory tune (4200 MT/s); stock 3200–3600 MT/s will decode proportionally slower.

> **GPU targeting note:** Scripts in this toolkit explicitly target the **Vega 8 iGPU**, auto-detected by PCI ID `0x1638`. With the dGPUs gone it is the only GPU: `/dev/dri/renderD128`, `card0`, ROCm agent index **0** (override with `VEGA8_ROCM_DEVICE=N`). These numbers are not stable — they shift whenever a dGPU is added or removed, and the 26.04 reinstall alone moved the Vega from `card1` to `card0`, which is why every script detects by PCI ID rather than hardcoding a node. Docker scripts pass only the Vega render node into the container so `ROCR_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0` applies there. Vulkan scripts auto-detect the `RADV RENOIR` device (currently `Vulkan0`).

## Performance

### Benchmarks — September 2026

`llama-bench -ngl 99`, ROCm carrying [`patches/0001`](patches/README.md), machine cooled
below 55 °C between runs, **iGPU at 2400 MHz** — since 2026-09-11 it runs at 2300 MHz, so a
re-run will show prefill roughly 4 % lower for that reason alone. Prefill = prompt processing, TG = token generation at that KV
depth. Every row is at the micro-batch that backend actually ships, given in its own
column — ROCm 4096, Vulkan 2048, CPU the 512 default. **TG does not depend on the
micro-batch**, so those columns carry over unchanged. Raw data:
[2026-09-08 matrix](bench/results/2026-09-08-matrix.tsv),
[`-ub` sweep](bench/results/2026-09-09-ub-sweep.tsv).

#### gemma-4-E4B-it Q4_K_M — dense, 7.5 B, head dim 512

| Backend | `-ub` | Prefill 4K | Prefill 16K | Prefill 32K | TG 4K | TG 16K | TG 32K |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| **ROCm `-fa 1`** | 4096 | **249.0** | **202.1** | **173.8** | 15.0 | 13.6 | **12.2** |
| ROCm `-fa 0` | 4096 | 205.3 | 177.3 | 149.5 | 12.0 | 9.3 | 7.1 |
| **Vulkan `-fa 1`** | 2048 | 179.4 | 155.1 | — | **17.3** | **15.3** | — |
| Vulkan `-fa 0` | 2048 | 166.5 | 150.3 | — | 15.0 | 12.0 | — |
| CPU `-fa 0` | 512 | 84.9 | 77.3 | 69.1 | 13.8 | 11.4 | 9.7 |
| CPU `-fa 1` | 512 | 89.4 | 78.0 | 67.1 | 12.6 | 7.9 | 5.3 |

**ROCm takes the dense model outright** — 30–39 % ahead of Vulkan on prefill at every
context, and the only backend that runs it at 32K at all. That is the largest single
result here, and it only appears at `-ub 4096`: the same rows at 2048 read
160 / 146 / 132, which is where this table used to stop.

#### Qwen3.5-35B-A3B Q4_K_M — MoE, 34.7 B total / ~3 B active, head dim 256

| Backend | `-ub` | Prefill 4K | Prefill 16K | Prefill 32K | TG 4K | TG 16K | TG 32K |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| **Vulkan `-fa 1`** | 2048 | **188.5** | 151.5 | **120.1** | **21.2** | **19.2** | **17.1** |
| Vulkan `-fa 0` | 2048 | 187.4 | **156.6** | 116.4 | 19.0 | 13.5 | 9.7 |
| **ROCm `-fa 1`** | 4096 | 151.9 | 130.1 | 112.6 | 18.8 | 17.5 | 15.9 |
| ROCm `-fa 0` | 4096 | 144.2 | 123.2 | 99.3 | 15.2 | 9.4 | 5.9 |
| CPU `-fa 0` | 512 | 83.9 | 71.7 | 59.7 | 16.1 | 13.5 | 11.1 |
| CPU `-fa 1` | 512 | 85.1 | 71.1 | 58.3 | 15.3 | 8.1 | 4.3 |

**Vulkan keeps the MoE model**, prefill and decode both. The bigger micro-batch is worth
only 3–9 % here against 23–55 % on the dense model: with 8 of 256 experts active, `-ub
2048` already puts 64 tokens on each expert — exactly MMQ's tile width — so there is
nothing left for 4096 to fill. **Backend choice for prefill follows model density.**

Two micro-batch findings sit behind the `-ub` column, both in the
[full sweep](docs/benchmarks.md#prefill-by-micro-batch-both-models-all-three-values):
**`-ub 8192` is a loss everywhere** (−0.4 % to −17.3 %, and one out-of-memory), and
**Vulkan at `-fa 0` loses ~8 % going from 2048 to 4096** — confirmed at `-r 3`, which is
why the Vulkan rows stay at 2048.

### How to read this

| Question | Answer |
|---|---|
| Which backend by default? | **Vulkan `-fa 1`** — it wins decode everywhere, wins the MoE model outright, and needs no local patch. The exception is prefill on a dense model, below |
| Fastest prefill on the dense model? | **ROCm `-fa 1` at `-ub 4096`**, at every context — 249 / 202 / 174 t/s against Vulkan's 179 / 155 / crash. Vulkan cannot run 32K on this model at all |
| Which `-fa` on ROCm? | **`-fa 1`, always.** With `patches/0001` it wins prefill *and* TG at every context. Without the patch, `-fa 0` |
| Which `-fa` on Vulkan? | **`-fa 1`** — the one exception is 16K prefill on the 35B, where `-fa 0` is 3 % faster |
| Which `-fa` on CPU? | **`-fa 0`.** `-fa 1` collapses with context — half the speed past 16K |
| Is ROCm worth it? | **On a dense model, yes** — it wins prefill at every context by 30–39 %. On the MoE it trails Vulkan in both prefill and decode, though long-context decode is now 8–20 % behind rather than 178 % |

## Quick Start

### After a fresh Ubuntu install — do this first

A reinstall keeps the `amdgpu` kernel module working but wipes everything this
project needs on top of it: the GRUB GTT params, `render`/`video` membership,
`/opt/rocm`, and the toolchain. This has bitten the rig twice (2026-06-13 and
2026-09-07); the second time the missing GTT params alone would have hard-frozen
the PC on the first large model. One command restores all of it:

```bash
sudo bash setup/bootstrap-host.sh --with-docker   # omit the flag to skip Docker
sudo reboot                                       # required: GRUB params + groups
```

Then verify:

```bash
grep -o 'amdgpu.gttsize=[0-9]*' /proc/cmdline          # expect 65536
awk '{print $1/1024/1024" MiB GTT"}' /sys/class/drm/card*/device/mem_info_gtt_total
/opt/rocm/bin/rocminfo | grep -m1 'Name:.*gfx'          # expect gfx90c
```

### Serving

```bash
# Vulkan / Mesa RADV on Vega 8 (default, best decode)
./run/start-llama-server.sh

# CPU only (best prefill at large context)
./run/start-llama-server.sh --cpu

# ROCm 7.2 via Docker (recommended ROCm path — best GPU prefill)
./run/start-llama-server.sh --rocm-docker
# or directly:
./run/run-docker-rocm7.sh /path/to/model.gguf -ngl 99 -c 8192 --no-warmup

# ROCm 7.2 baremetal (working again as of 2026-09-07 — classic ROCm 7.2 host)
./run/start-llama-server.sh --rocm

## ROCm on Vega 8

**Status (September 2026 — Ubuntu 26.04, kernel 7.0, classic ROCm 7.2.0):**

| Path                                | Status | Notes                                                                |
| ----------------------------------- | ------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Baremetal ROCm 7.2** (`run/run-rocm7-baremetal.sh`) | ✅ working — re-verified 2026-09-07 | Works again now that the modular `amdrocm-core` packages are gone with the dGPUs. Binary reports `gfx900:xnack-`, 65536 MiB. gemma-4-E4B `-fa 0`: **70.0 / 109.1 / 106.1 prefill, 15.9 / 14.5 / 11.9 decode** at the 16 GB carve-out — 29 % ahead of May 2026 at 1K |
| **Docker ROCm 7.2** (`run/run-docker-rocm7.sh`) | ✅ working — re-verified 2026-09-08 | Image rebuilt and benchmarked on both models. Prefill matches baremetal to within noise (35B 4K: 88.2 vs 89.0; gemma 4K: 106.0 vs 106.1). **The 35B loaded without the 2026-06-13 freeze** — that was missing GRUB params, not Docker. **Still requires the GTT GRUB params** (below) |
| **Docker ROCm 6.2.4** (`run/run-docker-rocm.sh`) | ROCm 6 comparison path | Self-contained `rocm/dev-ubuntu-24.04:6.2.4` image; last measured May 2026 (40–64 prefill / 12–14 decode on the 35B). Kept for ROCm-6-vs-7 comparison rather than for use |
| Baremetal HIP 5.7.1 (Ubuntu repo)   | ❌ broken | HIP 5.7.1 + Clang-21 mismatch — segfaults at slot init               |

> **The tables were re-baselined at `-ub 4096` on 2026-09-08** and the harness now sets
> it for GPU backends (`BENCH_UBATCH=512` reproduces the older numbers). The change was
> worth +58 % to +85 % on 4K prompts and flipped the dense-model prefill ranking.

**Why baremetal broke in June 2026, and why it works again:** the gfx900-on-gfx90c technique needs (a) `HSA_OVERRIDE_GFX_VERSION=9.0.0` and (b) gfx900 rocBLAS tensile kernels. AMD's modular packages (`amdrocm-core` 7.13/7.14), installed for the R9700s, **rejected** the override (`HSA_STATUS_ERROR_OUT_OF_RESOURCES`) and shipped no gfx9 kernels at all — and since llama.cpp's prefill GEMMs go through rocBLAS, even a native gfx90c rebuild could not have worked there. With the dGPUs moved out and classic ROCm 7.2.0 installed from repo.radeon.com, both preconditions hold again: the runtime accepts the override and the ROCm 6.3.4 tensile backport applies cleanly. `run/run-rocm7-baremetal.sh` still preflight-checks all of this and fails early with instructions if a modular-ROCm host reappears.

> ⚠️ **Large models on ROCm REQUIRE the GTT GRUB params.** On 2026-06-13, loading **Qwen3.5-35B-A3B-Q4_K_M** (20 GB) via ROCm **hard-froze the entire PC within ~3 seconds** — a fresh Ubuntu install had left GRUB without `amdgpu.gttsize=65536 ttm.pages_limit=16777216`, so the Vega 8 had only ~30 GB of GTT and the allocation overflowed it. With the params present the 35B loads to ~21 GB and runs on both paths — re-verified 2026-09-07 (baremetal) and 2026-09-08 (Docker), no freeze either time. `setup/bootstrap-host.sh` sets them; confirm with `grep -o 'amdgpu.gttsize=[0-9]*' /proc/cmdline`. **This warning stays because the failure mode is a hard lockup, not an error message** — if the params are missing, do not load >~10 GB models on ROCm; use Vulkan instead. See [Model Capacity](#model-capacity).

**Baremetal ROCm 7.2 worked before the host ROCm swap** (confirmed 2026-05-14) and still applies to hosts with classic ROCm 7.0–7.2 packages: install via `setup/install-rocm7-host.sh`, build via `build/build-llamacpp-rocm7-baremetal.sh`, run via `run/run-rocm7-baremetal.sh`. Two Ubuntu 25.10 workarounds required: use AMD's noble/24.04 packages (ABI-compatible), and create `sudo ln -sf /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libxml2.so.16 /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libxml2.so.2` for ROCm LLVM. The install script now refuses to run if modular `amdrocm-core` packages are present (they'd conflict over `/opt/rocm` and could break the R9700 setup).

```bash
# Start (auto-builds image on first run, ~10 min)
./run/run-docker-rocm.sh /path/to/model.gguf -ngl 99 -c 2048 --no-warmup

### Docker & `llama.cpp` Runtime Optimizations

The `run/run-docker-rocm.sh` script applies several crucial flags to maximize inference speed for the ROCm container on your APU:

#### Docker Flags
* `--ipc=host`: Essential for ROCm containers. Bypasses standard shared memory limits, allowing the GPU/CPU to exchange data structures continuously without bottlenecks.
* `--security-opt seccomp=unconfined`: Disables Docker's default syscall filtering. When passing raw character devices (`/dev/kfd`, `/dev/dri`), seccomp adds overhead; removing it grants native bare-metal performance.
* `--ulimit memlock=-1`: Allows unlimited locked memory pages. ROCm relies on memory pinning to stream data between system RAM and the GPU cores without CPU pagetable management. Docker's default limit severely bottlenecks ROCm or causes crashes.

#### `llama.cpp` Flags
* `-fa 1` (Flash Attention ON) **on a build carrying [`patches/0001`](patches/README.md)** — it wins both prefill and decode at every context, and lifts ROCm decode at 32K by 157 %. On a stock build FA costs 33–83 % of prefill on gfx900, so use `-fa 0` there. Never leave it at `auto`: the probe succeeds on gfx900 regardless of which build you are running. On CPU use `-fa 0` — `-fa 1` costs up to 61 % of decode at long context.
* `-ngl 99`: Offloads all layers to the GPU.
* `-b 4096 -ub 4096` (full-batch prefill): **the largest runtime knob** — +70 % ROCm prefill at a 3330-token prompt against the `-ub 512` default, +47 % even at 32K, with no decode cost. Smaller `-ub` *hurts* (under-fills the 8-CU GEMMs). Cap it by context on Vulkan, where a large enough attention dispatch hangs the compute ring; `run/start-llama-server.sh` derives the cap for you. See [docs/benchmarks.md](docs/benchmarks.md#micro-batch--ub--the-largest-runtime-knob).
* `-ctk q8_0` (recommended for long context): quantize the K cache — **+23.5 % ROCm decode at 32K**, +6.8 % at 4K, +2.7 % at 1K, and halves K-cache memory. The gain scales with context, which is why a 4K-only measurement in June recorded it as "+3.5 %, small".
* `-t N` (Recommended to add at runtime): Set to your physical CPU core count (e.g., `-t 4` or `-t 8`). Prevents CPU thrashing and saves thermal/power budget for the Vega iGPU.
* `-nkvo` (`--no-kv-offload`): **Do not use unless necessary!** Forces the Key-Value (KV) cache to stay in standard CPU RAM instead of VRAM. Only use this if your model is so large that adding a context window crashes the GPU with Out-of-Memory (OOM) errors.

See [docs/TROUBLESHOOTING.md](docs/TROUBLESHOOTING.md#docker-rocm-624-workaround-working-legacy-solution) for full details and the FP8 stub patch needed for gfx900.

### ROCm 7.2 on Vega 8 — the gfx900 backport technique

**Status: working in Docker** (re-verified 2026-06-13; baremetal variant requires classic ROCm 7.2 on the host — see status table above). ROCm 7.x officially dropped `gfx900` support, but the technique used by
[garymathews/frigate:440056a-rocm-7.2.0](https://github.com/garymathews/frigate/releases/tag/440056a-rocm-7.2.0)
(originally for Frigate NVR / MIGraphX object detection) can be adapted for llama.cpp:

- ROCm 7 LLVM still compiles `gfx900` device code via `hipcc`.
- `rocBLAS` 7.x ships without `gfx900` tensile GEMM kernels — so large-matrix multiply falls back to a slow reference path or fails entirely.
- **Fix:** copy the prebuilt `gfx900` `.co` kernel files **and `TensileLibrary_lazy_gfx900.dat`** from the ROCm **6.3.4** `rocblas` package into ROCm 7's library directory. rocBLAS probes that directory at runtime and picks them up automatically. The lazy `.dat` index file is essential — without it ROCm 7 crashes on the first GEMM with `Illegal seek for GPU arch: gfx900`.

#### Option A — Docker (recommended)

```bash
# Build the image (one-time, ~20–40 min — downloads ROCm 6.3.4 rocblas inside)
docker build -t llama-rocm7-vega -f build/Dockerfile.rocm7-vega build/

# Run (auto-selects Vega 8 render node)
./run/run-docker-rocm7.sh /path/to/model.gguf -ngl 99 -c 2048
```

#### Option B — Baremetal (requires classic ROCm 7.2 on the host)

> ✅ Working, re-verified 2026-09-07 on Ubuntu 26.04 / kernel 7.0 / ROCm 7.2.0.
> Requires **classic** ROCm 7.0–7.2; the scripts abort early if AMD's modular
> `amdrocm-core` packages are present, since those reject the gfx version
> override the Vega 8 depends on.

```bash
# One-time host setup (Ubuntu 25.10/26.04 — uses noble/24.04 AMD packages).
# The libxml2 soname shim (.so.2 -> .so.16) is applied automatically, scoped
# to /opt/rocm/lib so no system package is touched.
sudo bash setup/install-rocm7-host.sh

# Build (downloads gfx900 tensile backport, then compiles llama.cpp)
export PATH=/opt/rocm/bin:$PATH
bash build/build-llamacpp-rocm7-baremetal.sh
# Subsequent runs (tensile already installed):
bash build/build-llamacpp-rocm7-baremetal.sh --skip-backport

# Run (auto-detects Vega 8 device index)
bash run/run-rocm7-baremetal.sh /path/to/model.gguf -ngl 99 -c 8192
```

> **Device index note:** The Vega 8's ROCm GPU index depends on which dGPUs are installed — **0** now that it is the only GPU (it was 2 with the two R9700s). The run script auto-detects it; override with `VEGA8_ROCM_DEVICE=N` if needed. When setting manually, remember `HIP_VISIBLE_DEVICES` indexes into the `ROCR_VISIBLE_DEVICES`-filtered list, so use `ROCR_VISIBLE_DEVICES=<idx> HIP_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0`.

## LM Studio (Vulkan)

[`run/launch-lmstudio-vulkan.sh`](run/launch-lmstudio-vulkan.sh) launches LM Studio with the correct Vulkan environment for Vega 8.

```bash
./run/launch-lmstudio-vulkan.sh              # Launch with Vulkan backend
./run/launch-lmstudio-vulkan.sh --diagnose   # Check GPU/memory, show backend targets
./run/launch-lmstudio-vulkan.sh --dry-run    # Print config without launching
```

> LM Studio's bundled ROCm backend only targets RDNA2+ (gfx1030+). Always select **Vulkan** in *Settings → My GPUs*.

## TODO

- [x] Build llama.cpp with ROCm/HIP for gfx900
- [x] Fix xnack (plain gfx900 = xnack-agnostic)
- [x] Fix COv6 incompatibility (force `-mcode-object-version=5`)
- [x] Isolate host crash to HIP 5.7.1 / Clang-21 version mismatch
- [x] Fix GRUB params for 64 GB GTT (`amdgpu.gttsize=65536 ttm.pages_limit=16777216`)
- [x] **Docker ROCm 6.2.4 — working, full GPU offload confirmed**
- [x] **Build llama.cpp with Vulkan backend**
- [x] **Test Vulkan on Vega 8 (stable)**
- [x] **Create Vulkan launcher scripts**
- [x] Benchmark all backends (ROCm Docker, Vulkan native, CPU, LM Studio)
- [x] Document all findings
- [x] **Benchmark flash attention ON vs OFF for all backends** — FA OFF wins for both ROCm 6 and ROCm 7 on Vega 8; FA ON wins for CPU (AVX2 SDPA); see [benchmarks.md](docs/benchmarks.md)
- [x] **Re-run ROCm 6 + CPU benchmarks with consistent settings** — done 2026-05-14, `-c 8192 --no-warmup`, both FA ON and FA OFF
- [x] **Install official AMD ROCm 7.2 on host** — done 2026-05-14 via `setup/install-rocm7-host.sh`; Ubuntu 25.10 uses noble/24.04 packages (ABI-compatible); two workarounds needed (libxml2.so.2 symlink, hip-dev package)
- [x] **Housekeeping: reorganised into build/ run/ bench/ folders**
- [x] **Test ROCm 7.2 Docker build on Vega 8** (`build/Dockerfile.rocm7-vega` + `run/run-docker-rocm7.sh`) — confirmed working 2026-05-14, 35B full offload
- [x] **Baremetal ROCm 7.2 build working** — confirmed 2026-05-14; binary sees Vega 8 as `gfx900:xnack-` with 65536 MiB; `ROCR_VISIBLE_DEVICES=1` (Vega 8 is GPU index 1 with RX 9700 as index 0)
- [x] **Compare ROCm 6.x vs ROCm 7.x inference speed on Vega 8** — both benefit from `-fa 0`; ROCm 7 FA OFF (70 t/s) edges out ROCm 6 FA OFF (64 t/s) at 1K/4K context; CPU FA ON wins overall (233 t/s at 4K)
- [x] **Adopt improvements from mixa3607/ML-gfx906** (same GCN5/Vega arch, gfx906): disable `GGML_HIP_GRAPHS` everywhere (stability fix), add `GGML_BACKEND_DL=ON` + `GGML_CPU_ALL_VARIANTS=ON` to ROCm 7 builds, apply to ROCm 6 Docker too, add `numactl` to Docker images, `hipconfig`-based HIP compiler auto-detection in build scripts
- [x] Benchmark ROCm 7 builds after `GGML_HIP_GRAPHS=OFF` + `GGML_BACKEND_DL=ON` — rebuild succeeded 2026-05-14; **re-benchmarking needed** to compare before/after performance
- [x] **Hardware change (June 2026):** RTX 5090 removed, second Radeon AI PRO R9700 added; host ROCm replaced by modular `amdrocm-core` 7.13/7.14 (gfx120x) — Vega 8 is now ROCm GPU index 2 / `renderD130`
- [x] **Toolkit fixes (2026-06-13):** repaired broken Vega-8 ROCm index auto-detect (always returned 0 → would select an R9700), fixed `HIP_VISIBLE_DEVICES` misuse, removed dangerous `HSA_XNACK=1` from the benchmark runner, added preflight guards for the modular-ROCm host, switched default launcher backend to Vulkan, removed dead CMake flags (`GGML_HIP_UMA`, `GGML_FLASH_ATTN`); Vulkan + Docker ROCm 7.2 paths re-verified on hardware
- [x] **Hardware + OS change (September 2026):** both R9700s moved to another machine — the Vega 8 is the only GPU again (`card0` / `renderD128` / ROCm index 0). OS reinstalled as Ubuntu 26.04.1 / kernel 7.0; classic ROCm 7.2.0 restored from repo.radeon.com, so **baremetal ROCm works again** — re-verified 2026-09-07 against the May 2026 gemma-4-E4B numbers, which both Vulkan and ROCm reproduce (see [benchmarks.md](docs/benchmarks.md))
- [x] **Post-reinstall recovery is now one command** — `setup/bootstrap-host.sh` restores GRUB GTT params, `render`/`video` groups, toolchain, Vulkan userspace, optional Docker and ROCm. Written after the reinstall wiped the host config for the second time (2026-06-13, 2026-09-07); the missing GTT params alone hard-freeze the PC on a large model
- [x] **Script fixes (2026-09-07):** `install-rocm7-host.sh` added *root* rather than the invoking user to `render`/`video` under `sudo` (`$USER` vs `$SUDO_USER`), and `dpkg -l | grep -q` aborted it via SIGPIPE under `pipefail` before anything installed; libxml2 soname shim is now automatic and scoped to `/opt/rocm/lib`. `build-llamacpp-rocm7-baremetal.sh` had `CMAKE_INSTALL_RPATH=$ORIGIN`, but upstream moved `libllama-*-impl.so` to `lib/`, so installed binaries would not start — now `$ORIGIN;$ORIGIN/../lib`
- [x] **Re-verify gemma-4-E4B on 26.04 (2026-09-07)** — Vulkan and ROCm both reproduce the May 2026 numbers; Vulkan `-fa 1` remains the best path. Added `build/build-llamacpp-vulkan.sh` (the harness needed `llm/vulkan/` for both its Vulkan *and* CPU rows, and no script in the repo built it)
- [x] **Harness bugs found while re-verifying (2026-09-07)** — (a) `_detect_vega8_rocm_index` printed an *empty* string when the Vega is GPU 0, because awk's `print gpu` on an unassigned variable emits nothing; that set `ROCR_VISIBLE_DEVICES=""` and silently ran ROCm benchmarks on the CPU. Masked until the dGPUs left. (b) `start_cpu` used `-ngl 0`, which no longer keeps the model off the GPU now that upstream defaults `-ngl` to `auto` — the "CPU" rows were GPU runs. Now `-dev none`
- [x] **CPU prefill gap resolved (2026-09-08)** — the pre-September CPU rows were measured with `-ngl 0`, which no longer forces CPU-only execution (91 % GPU busy, 6.5 GB in GTT), so they are GPU runs mislabelled as CPU. Real CPU-only prefill is 99 / 98 / 93 t/s on gemma, confirmed by `llama-bench -dev none` and the server harness independently (within 3 %). The May figure of 840 t/s is 1.6–3× above the arithmetic ceiling of eight Zen 3 cores and cannot be a real measurement. Harness fixed to `-dev none`; historical rows struck through
- [x] **Cooling fixed enough to stop throttling (2026-09-07)** — raising the fan curve took the peak from 105.4 °C to 89.5 °C, the average from 90.5 °C to 79.7 °C, and samples over Tjmax from 27 to **0**; iGPU SCLK now holds 2400 → 2351 MHz instead of dropping to 2208. Worth ~6–8 % prefill on every backend, so all published numbers were re-measured after the fix
- [x] **BIOS retune (2026-09-07)** — UMA carve-out 2 → 16 GB, Curve Optimizer −10 → −15, IOMMU off, iGPU boost +200 MHz, throttle limit 90 → 99 °C. Net on gemma: ROCm +22 % prefill / +12 % decode, Vulkan +5 % decode, CPU ~unchanged; peak temp fell to 86.6 °C. The iGPU boost changed the DPM table but not the observed 2400 MHz clock, and IOMMU off changed nothing measurable
- [x] **`-fa auto` trap fixed in the ROCm launcher (2026-09-08)** — `run/run-rocm7-baremetal.sh` passed no `-fa`, so it resolved to `auto`, which probes the backend, finds the generic FA tile kernel compiles for gfx900, and enables flash attention. Measured on gemma at a 3330-token prompt: `-fa 0` = 112.8 t/s, `-fa 1` = 48.9, **`-fa auto` = 48.9**. Anyone using the launcher without passing `-fa 0` was silently getting 43 % of achievable prefill. Both ROCm launchers now pass `-fa` explicitly, and they differ on purpose: `-fa 1` for baremetal, which carries `patches/0001`, and `-fa 0` for the Docker image, which does not. The `auto` probe cannot tell a patched build from a stock one
- [x] **Qwen3.5-35B re-benchmarked (2026-09-07)** — 20 GB model loads on ROCm without the documented hard freeze. Vulkan `-fa 1` is the best path (21 t/s decode to 4K, 159 t/s prefill at 1K); both GPU backends beat May 2026 by 12–24 %
- [x] **Flash attention fixed on gfx900 (2026-09-08)** — `V_DOT2_F32_F16_AVAILABLE` excludes GCN5, so the FA KQ accumulate fell back to 5 VALU ops per 2 MACs with an fp16 product, and its intermediates pushed 50 of 60 config rows into spilling (up to 2262 VGPRs). gfx900 has `v_mad_mix_f32` — 1 op per MAC, product in fp32. `patches/0001`: ROCm decode at 32K **6.16 → 15.86 t/s (+157 %)** on the 35B, **7.61 → 12.49 (+64 %)** on gemma; spills 10 598 → 6; gap to Vulkan at 32K from 178 % to 8 %; error vs fp64 from 6.1e-3 to 1.4e-6. `test-backend-ops` 2959/2959. A first attempt that raised occupancy instead fixed the symptom and was dropped — it is a net loss on top of this one
- [x] **`-ub 4096` adopted, capped by context (2026-09-08)** — worth +47 % to +85 % prefill on long prompts, but a large enough attention dispatch hangs the Vulkan compute ring, so the launcher derives `min(4096, 2²⁵/CTX)`. The threshold tracks `n_kv × ubatch × head_dim` — `n_kv` being the tokens **actually in the KV cache**, not the allocated context. Verified 2026-09-09 by holding the allocation at 128K and varying only the prompt: 6 021 tokens fine, ~16 000 wedges the ring. Allocating a big context is free; filling it is not. The launcher derives from `CTX` because a server must survive a full-context prompt
- [x] **`-ctk q8_0` adopted for long context (2026-09-08)** — +2.7 % at 1K but **+23.5 % at 32K**; June's "+3.5 %, small" was measured only at 4K
- [x] **Clock pinning dropped (2026-09-08)** — no effect now that the cooling fix stopped the throttling that made it look useful in June
- [x] **Prefill matrix at `-ub 4096` (2026-09-09)** — 26 cells, 25 completed, zero ring resets. The gain turns out to be a property of the model, not the context: dense +23–55 % at every context and both FA settings, MoE +3–9 %. That inverts the dense-model prefill recommendation — ROCm now wins gemma at 4K, 16K and 32K. Vulkan at `-fa 0` *regresses* ~8 % with the larger micro-batch, in two independent cells. Raw data in [bench/results/2026-09-09-ub-sweep.tsv](bench/results/2026-09-09-ub-sweep.tsv)
- [x] **`-ub` cap split per backend (2026-09-09)** — the derived cap came from Vulkan crashes, and ROCm ran the exact product that kills Vulkan at 99.31 t/s. `start-llama-server.sh` now derives `min(4096, 2²⁵/CTX)` for Vulkan only; **ROCm gets a flat `-ub 4096`**, which the sweep the same day showed is both the optimum and far inside safe territory (it ran 8× that product without a ring reset)
- [x] **`-ub 8192` probed and rejected (2026-09-09)** — a loss on every cell that ran: 35B −0.4 to −4.9 %, gemma −6.3 to −17.3 %, and the 35B at 32K/`-fa 0` would not run at all. The premise ("prefill was still climbing at 4096") came from a pre-patch `-fa 0` sweep; the climb does not continue. **`-ub 4096` is the optimum — do not raise it.** The run also settled ROCm's watchdog headroom: gemma at 32K with `-ub 8192` is `n_kv × ub × head` = 137e9, eight times the product that reliably kills Vulkan, and it ran clean
- [x] **Vulkan `-fa 0` micro-batch regression confirmed (2026-09-09)** — re-measured at `-r 3`: raising `-ub` from 2048 to 4096 costs **8.0 %** on the 35B at 16K (156.39 → 143.93) and **8.7 %** on gemma at 4K (166.42 → 151.98), at standard deviations under 0.2 t/s — about 50 σ on the 35B. Both `-fa 1` controls are flat or positive, so the flash-attention flag alone flips the sign: without FA the KQ intermediate is materialised at `n_kv × n_ubatch` and a larger micro-batch doubles it. The default path is unaffected (`start-llama-server.sh` passes `-fa 1` on Vulkan); pass `-ub 2048` if you deliberately use `-fa 0` there. Every `-r 3` value reproduced its `-r 1` counterpart to within 0.2 %
- [ ] **`build/Dockerfile.rocm7-vega` cannot build from a clean cache** — it does `COPY --from=rocm/dev-ubuntu-22.04:6.3.4 /opt/rocm/lib/rocblas/library/`, and that image today contains no rocBLAS at all: no package, and neither `/opt/rocm/lib/rocblas/library` nor `/opt/rocm-6.3.4/lib/rocblas/library` exists. The working `llama-rocm7-vega` image only builds because that layer is cached from when the upstream image still carried rocBLAS. A fresh machine gets a failed build. Fix: download the rocBLAS 6.3.4 `.deb` from `repo.radeon.com` and extract the gfx900 files, as `build/build-llamacpp-rocm7-baremetal.sh` and `build/Dockerfile.pytorch-rocm72-vega` already do
- [ ] **Send `patches/0001` upstream** — it fixes the whole GCN5 class, not just this box
- [x] **ROCm 7.14 made to work on this APU (2026-09-11)** — AMD's gfx900 wheels segfault in `hsa_init()` → `GpuAgent::InitDma()`, but a *different* 7.14 build of the same source (`mixa3607/rocm-gfx906:7.14-complete`) enumerates this GPU fine, which proves the crash is that wheel build rather than the 7.14 source. Combining their runtime with the 182 gfx900 Tensile files out of AMD's wheel gives a working ROCm 7.14: `test-backend-ops -o FLASH_ATTN_EXT` **2959/2959**, and a full 12-cell matrix (both models, prefill and decode, 4K–32K, measured back to back) within noise on **11 of 12 cells**. The exception is **gemma decode, consistently ~8–9 % slower** at every context. Not `patches/0001`: the gap survives `-fa 0`, where neither flash attention nor the patch is used. Working explanation is compiler code generation on llama.cpp's dense GEMV decode kernels, which the MoE model does not use. [`build/Dockerfile.rocm714-mixa-gfx900`](build/Dockerfile.rocm714-mixa-gfx900), results in [bench/results/2026-09-11-rocm714-working.md](bench/results/2026-09-11-rocm714-working.md). **The 6.3.4 backport into ROCm 7.2 stays the default** — tested longer and currently a little faster — but it is no longer the only option
- [ ] **TheRock can build ROCm natively for `gfx90c` — no override, no backport.** Upstream has a first-class target: `therock_add_amdgpu_target(gfx90c "AMD Renoir/Lucienne/Cezanne iGPU" FAMILY igpu-all gfx90c-igpu)`, with the same exclusion list as gfx900 (hipBLASLt, hipSPARSELt, composable_kernel, rocWMMA, hipTensor, rocprofiler-compute — each with a linked upstream issue). This is the principled fix for [the modular-ROCm item below](#todo): a ROCm 7.x built for the actual silicon, retiring `HSA_OVERRIDE_GFX_VERSION=9.0.0` and the Tensile copy at once. Cost is a very long from-source build. [mixa3607/ML-gfx906](https://github.com/mixa3607/ML-gfx906) is a working template — it does exactly this for gfx906 via TheRock and is parameterised by `ROCM_ARCH`, so pointing it at gfx90c is a configuration change rather than a port. Try the prebuilt gfx900 SDK above first; it is hours cheaper and may make this unnecessary
- [ ] **Use the ML-gfx906 pipeline as the template for the whole ML stack.** [mixa3607/ML-gfx906](https://github.com/mixa3607/ML-gfx906) is not directly usable here — it targets gfx906, and its recent commits are a Vega20 metrics exporter — but it is standing proof that the full chain works for a *dropped* gfx9 architecture: a TheRock-built ROCm 7.14, then **PyTorch 2.13.0**, ComfyUI, vLLM and llama.cpp built against it, published as Docker images and an APT repo (`docker.io/mixa3607/pytorch-gfx906:v2.13.0-rocm-7.14`). That is the answer to being pinned to `torch 2.7.0+rocm6.3`, which is the only stock wheel with gfx900 kernels. Their whole pipeline is parameterised by `ROCM_ARCH`, and separate per-component directories (`rocm/`, `rocm-tensile/`, `pytorch/`, `comfyui/`, `vllm-v2/`) mean each stage can be retargeted independently rather than as one monolith. `rocm-tensile/` is worth reading on its own: it rebuilds Tensile kernels for a dropped arch against 6.3.3 / 6.4.4 / 7.0.0 / 7.0.2, which is the general form of what `patches/` and the 6.3.4 file copy do by hand here. Note they exclude hipBLASLt (see their `HIPBLASLT-GFX906.md`), which breaks INT8 `torch._int_mm` — the same exclusion TheRock applies to gfx900 and gfx90c
- [x] **Newer PyTorch tried and abandoned (2026-09-11)** — `torch 2.11.0+rocm7.2` with the 128 gfx900 rocBLAS files injected passes the smoke test and basic pointwise ops, so PyTorch's ATen kernels *are* built for gfx900. But the full correctness verification **hard-froze the host twice**, once with a CPU overclock on and once with it off, while the same verification passes all 11 checks on `torch 2.7.0+rocm6.3`. Not pursued further — stay on 2.7.0. See [docs/PYTORCH.md](docs/PYTORCH.md). Also found on the way: **after any GPU hang on this APU, reboot** — a driver reset reports recovery but every later job hangs until a reboot
- [x] **PyTorch verified working on the Vega 8 (2026-09-10).** `torch 2.7.0+rocm6.3` sees the iGPU as `gfx900:xnack-` and every library in question computes correctly — rocBLAS fp32/fp16 matmul, **rocRAND**, MIOpen conv2d, each checked against a CPU reference rather than for the absence of a crash. 1.40 TFLOP/s fp32, ~57 % of this iGPU's theoretical peak. **No Tensile backport and no source build were needed**: the stock wheel bundles its own gfx900 rocBLAS/rocRAND/MIOpen, so `HSA_OVERRIDE_GFX_VERSION=9.0.0` is the whole trick. That retires rocRAND as the gate it was thought to be — issue #1 saw it blocked under *modular* ROCm 7.14.1 where its kernels sit in a `.kpack`; the wheel never touches that packaging. [`build/Dockerfile.pytorch-rocm63-vega`](build/Dockerfile.pytorch-rocm63-vega), [`run/run-pytorch-rocm63.sh`](run/run-pytorch-rocm63.sh), results in [bench/results/2026-09-10-pytorch-gfx900-smoke.txt](bench/results/2026-09-10-pytorch-gfx900-smoke.txt)
- [ ] **ComfyUI / Stable Diffusion on the Vega 8, now that PyTorch is proven.** The compute path works; the open questions are memory and speed rather than support. SD1.5 at 512×512 should fit, SDXL will need `--lowvram`. Worth knowing what 1.40 TFLOP/s fp32 and DDR4 bandwidth actually deliver per image before promising anything
- [ ] **Explain ROCm's gain from the BIOS retune** — per-phase sampling shows **ROCm never uses the BIOS carve-out** (VRAM ~300 MB, whole model in GTT) on both gemma and the 35B, so the carve-out cannot be the cause. An earlier commit claimed it was, from a whole-run VRAM peak that actually belonged to the Vulkan phase; corrected in [benchmarks.md](docs/benchmarks.md). The real cause is unidentified — four other settings changed at once
- [ ] **Repaste the CPU** — peak is 86.6 °C on a 65 W APU. Not throttling, but the throttle limit is now set to 99 °C, above the 95 °C stock Tjmax, so the usual safety margin is gone
- [x] **Docker ROCm 7.2 image rebuilt with `patches/0001` (2026-09-09)** — the Dockerfiles now apply `patches/` through the same `build/apply-patches.sh` the host builds use, so all four build paths compile identical sources and a patch that no longer applies fails the build instead of silently vanishing. Verified in the image: gemma decode at depth 16384 goes 10.14 → 13.99 t/s (+38 %) with `-fa 1`, so both ROCm launchers now default to `-fa 1`. The image records what it applied in `/app/.applied-patches.diff`. Adding a `.dockerignore` cut the build context from 1.8 GB to 366 bytes. Still open: the ROCm 6.2.4 image has never finished building, and the 35B-A3B model is not present in the Docker path
- [ ] **ROCm 7.2 / Vega 8 tuning sweep (in progress, June 2026):** baseline 35B → `-ub`/`-b` batch sizes → `-ctk q8_0` K-cache quant → `rocm-smi --setperflevel high` → maybe `-DGGML_CUDA_FORCE_MMQ=ON`. Harness: `bench/tune-rocm7-vega.sh`. Ceiling analysis (no hardware dp4a, DDR4 bandwidth-bound) in [docs/ARCHITECTURE.md](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) and [docs/benchmarks.md](docs/benchmarks.md)
- [ ] Document `numactl --membind=0 llama-server` usage for NUMA-sensitive workloads
- [x] **Vega 8 detection extracted into `lib/vega8.sh` (2026-09-09)** — the PCI-ID render node, the rocminfo agent index, the card/hwmon directories, the PCI address and the RADV Vulkan device were each reimplemented in three or four scripts and had drifted. One of the copies carried the `print gpu` bug that silently benchmarked the CPU. Now sourced by all eight `run/` and `bench/` scripts, each function overridable (`VEGA8_PCI_ID`, `VEGA8_RENDER_NODE`, `VEGA8_CARD_DIR`, `VEGA8_ROCM_DEVICE`, `VEGA8_VULKAN_DEV`). This also closed the hardcoded `-dev Vulkan0` in the benchmark harness
- [ ] Make the server port configurable end-to-end — the Docker launchers hardcode the `-p 8080:8080` mapping, so `PORT=` in `run/start-llama-server.sh` only works for the Vulkan/CPU/baremetal modes
- [x] **llama.cpp pinned across all four build paths (2026-09-08)** — `build/llama.cpp-ref` holds the commit; the baremetal script, the Vulkan script and both Dockerfiles read it (`--build-arg LLAMA_CPP_REF`). They had each cloned `master` independently, which is how a 465e49b baremetal came to be compared against a 67672dc image. `build/llama-cpp-ref.sh` rejects short SHAs — `git fetch --depth 1` cannot fetch them, and a build silently compiled the wrong commit once
- [ ] **Speculative decoding on Vega 8** — decode is DDR4-bandwidth-bound (~25–30 t/s ceiling for the 35B-A3B at 4200 MT/s); draft-token batching is the only lever past that ceiling since drafted tokens are verified in one batched pass over the weights. Test `llama-server -md <draft.gguf> --draft-max 16 --draft-min 1` with a small same-family draft (e.g. Qwen3.5-0.5B/1.7B Q4). Expected +30–80 % decode if acceptance rate is good; works today on the iGPU alone, and if a dGPU accelerator is installed later, pin the draft to it with `--device-draft`
- [ ] **MoE hybrid CPU+iGPU experiment — the premise no longer holds.** It was written when CPU prefill (233 t/s) appeared to beat GPU prefill (84 t/s). Both numbers are dead: 233 t/s came from the `-ngl 0` bug and was never a CPU measurement at all, and 84 t/s was ROCm at `-ub 512`. Current figures invert the comparison — CPU ~84 t/s against ROCm 136–160 t/s — so moving the expert FFNs to the CPU would now *cost* prefill. Keep it only as a way to fit a model that does not otherwise fit: `--override-tensor "ffn_.*_exps.*=CPU"` to run the expert FFNs on the CPU while attention/shared weights stay on the iGPU. On UMA there is no transfer penalty — only the compute engine changes — so this is a cheap test with real upside for prefill
- [ ] **Quant-format decode sweep** — decode is bandwidth-bound, so smaller quants can win despite costlier dequant: benchmark Q4_K_M vs IQ4_XS vs Q4_0 of the same model on Vulkan and ROCm
- [ ] **RAM timing tune + FCLK check** — decode scales ~linearly with DDR4 bandwidth: tighten secondary/tertiary timings at 4200 MT/s and verify FCLK runs 1:1 (2100 MHz — Cezanne usually manages it; 2:1 costs latency). Re-run `bench/run-all-benchmarks.sh` after
- [ ] **Raise PPT / PBO power limit** — stock 65 W PPT throttles sustained iGPU clocks under combined CPU+iGPU load; the all-core −10 undervolt is already applied, a higher PPT is the next lever
- [ ] **Transparent Huge Pages experiment** — `transparent_hugepage=always` reduces TLB pressure on large GTT allocations; cheap A/B benchmark
- [ ] **Benchmark methodology** — the 50-token decode window is noisy: raise to 256+, add 2–3 repeats with stddev, log power via `rocm-smi` for perf/W, and add standard `llama-bench` pp512/tg128 rows for cross-project comparability
- [ ] **Track upstream llama.cpp** — after pinning (above), bump the pin periodically and re-run the benchmark suite as a regression/gain check (the Vulkan backend improves fast); same for host Mesa/RADV updates
- [ ] **CI smoke checks** — GitHub Action running `shellcheck` + `bash -n` over `run/ bench/ build/` and `py_compile` over the python benches
- [ ] **Future accelerator (AMD or NVIDIA dGPU)** — both R9700s now live in another machine (September 2026), so this rig is iGPU-only. If a dGPU returns: benchmark it on this same harness and use it as the draft-model device for speculative decoding on the Vega 8 (`--device-draft`)
- [ ] **Restore baremetal ROCm on Vega 8 under modular ROCm:** two preconditions failed in June 2026 — the modular runtime rejected `HSA_OVERRIDE_GFX_VERSION` with `HSA_STATUS_ERROR_OUT_OF_RESOURCES`, *and* no gfx9 kernels shipped. [Issue #1](https://github.com/daimonionnn/amd-vega-rocm-vulkan-llm-toolkit/issues/1) resolves the second under modular `amdrocm*7.14.1` by copying the ROCm 6.3.4 gfx900 files — but on native gfx900 hardware, which never needed the override. It does show the modular runtime runs gfx9 kernels happily, which points at the override rejection as a separate cause worth re-testing rather than at the packaging. Until then: rocBLAS/Tensile built from source for gfx90c natively, or the Docker path, which covers the use case meanwhile
- [ ] **Future / community:** Vega 56/64 (gfx900) and Radeon VII/MI50/MI60 (gfx906) discrete GPU support — PyTorch, ComfyUI, vLLM. The rocBLAS backport is **confirmed working on discrete Vega10** (Radeon Pro V340 / MI25-class) by [issue #1](https://github.com/daimonionnn/amd-vega-rocm-vulkan-llm-toolkit/issues/1), correctness-verified, so the technique is not APU-specific. See [docs/ARCHITECTURE.md — ROCm library support on gfx900](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md#rocm-library-support-on-gfx900--what-needs-backporting-and-what-does-not) and [mixa3607/ML-gfx906](https://github.com/mixa3607/ML-gfx906).
