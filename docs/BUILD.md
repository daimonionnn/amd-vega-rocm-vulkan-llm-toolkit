# Build Guide

Building llama.cpp from source with ROCm/HIP support for the AMD Vega 8 APU (gfx90c).

## Why Build From Source?

LM Studio's bundled ROCm backend only includes kernels for RDNA2+ GPUs (gfx1030 and newer). The Vega 8 iGPU uses the GCN 5 architecture (gfx90c), which isn't supported. Building llama.cpp ourselves lets us target `gfx900` — the closest official ROCm target to gfx90c.

> **Status (June 2026):**
> - **Ubuntu's own HIP packages** — on Ubuntu 25.10 the distro shipped HIP 5.7.1/Clang-21, a ~2 major version mismatch that segfaulted during GPU inference (`run/run-llamaserver-rocm.sh`, kept only for reference). Ubuntu 26.04 ships `libamdhip64-dev` 7.1 instead, which has not been tested here — this project installs AMD's own ROCm 7.2 packages and uses those.
> - **ROCm 6.2.4 Docker** (`./run/run-docker-rocm.sh`) — stable, full GPU offload confirmed.
> - **ROCm 7.2 Docker** (`./run/run-docker-rocm7.sh`) — re-verified 2026-06-13; 35B full offload stable, gfx900 tensile backport applied. **Recommended ROCm path.**
> - **ROCm 7.2 Baremetal** — **working again, re-verified 2026-09-07** on Ubuntu 26.04 / kernel 7.0 with classic ROCm 7.2.0 (built with `GGML_HIP_GRAPHS=OFF`, `GGML_BACKEND_DL=ON`, `GGML_CPU_ALL_VARIANTS=ON`). It was broken May–September 2026 only because the modular `amdrocm-core` 7.13+/gfx120x packages had replaced classic ROCm for the R9700s; with the dGPUs gone and classic ROCm reinstalled, the path works. Install via `setup/bootstrap-host.sh` (or `setup/install-rocm7-host.sh` alone), build via `build/build-llamacpp-rocm7-baremetal.sh`, run via `run/run-rocm7-baremetal.sh`.
>
> For native GPU inference without ROCm, **use Vulkan** (the `run/start-llama-server.sh` default) — see [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md#vulkan-vs-rocm-on-this-system).
>
> **Device note:** The Vega 8 is currently the only GPU — `/dev/dri/renderD128`, ROCm agent index **0**. Both Docker scripts still auto-detect the render node by PCI ID (`0x1638`) and pass only that device into the container, and `run/run-rocm7-baremetal.sh` still auto-detects the agent index, so nothing needs changing if a dGPU is added back (with the two R9700s installed these were `renderD130` and index 2).

## Prerequisites

### Required Packages

```bash
# HIP compiler and ROCm tools
sudo apt install -y hipcc

# hipBLAS (GPU-accelerated BLAS for ROCm)
sudo apt install -y libhipblas-dev

# Build tools
sudo apt install -y cmake git build-essential python3
```

On Ubuntu 25.10 the distro's `hipcc` pulled in `clang-21`, `llvm-21`, `libamdhip64-dev`, and `rocm-device-libs-21`. On this host the AMD repo is pinned at priority 600, so `hipcc` resolves to AMD's `1.1.1.70200-43~24.04` instead.

### CMake Symlinks (Ubuntu Multiarch Fix)

Ubuntu puts HIP/ROCm CMake configs under `/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/cmake/` instead of the standard `/usr/lib/cmake/`. CMake can't find them without symlinks:

```bash
for dir in hip hip-lang hipblas rocblas rocsolver AMDDeviceLibs amd_comgr; do
    src="/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/cmake/$dir"
    dst="/usr/lib/cmake/$dir"
    if [ -d "$src" ] && [ ! -e "$dst" ]; then
        sudo ln -sf "$src" "$dst"
        echo "Linked: $dir"
    fi
done
```

The build script handles the `CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH` automatically, but the symlinks ensure CMake's `find_package()` works consistently.

### Verify Setup

```bash
hipcc --version        # Should show HIP version and clang
cmake --version        # Need 3.21+
rocminfo 2>/dev/null   # Should list your GPU (with HSA_OVERRIDE_GFX_VERSION=9.0.0)
```

## Building

```bash
cd LLMToolkit
chmod +x build/build-llamacpp-rocm-vega.sh
./build/build-llamacpp-rocm-vega.sh
```

### Pinned commit and local patches

All four build paths — the baremetal script, the Vulkan script and both Dockerfiles —
compile the **same llama.cpp commit**, taken from [`build/llama.cpp-ref`](../build/llama.cpp-ref).
They each used to clone `master` independently, which on 2026-09-08 produced a baremetal
install at `465e49b` and a Docker image at `67672dc` and made the two non-comparable.

The scripts read the pin through `build/llama-cpp-ref.sh`; the Dockerfiles take it as
`ARG LLAMA_CPP_REF`, passed by `run/run-docker-rocm*.sh`. It must be a full 40-character
SHA — `git fetch --depth 1 origin <short-sha>` fails with "couldn't find remote ref", and
a script that ignores that silently compiles whatever the checkout already had.

After checkout, `build/apply-patches.sh` applies everything in
[`patches/`](../patches/README.md) in filename order. Currently one patch, which makes the
flash-attention KQ accumulate use `v_mad_mix_f32` on gfx900 and is worth +157 % ROCm
decode at 32K context.
**A patch that no longer applies is a hard error**, not a warning: it means the pin moved
and the patch needs re-validating, and building without it would quietly undo a measured
improvement.

To move the pin: edit `build/llama.cpp-ref`, rebuild every path, re-check that each patch
still applies, and re-run the benchmarks that justify them.

### What the Build Script Does

1. **Clones/updates** llama.cpp from `ggml-org/llama.cpp` master branch
2. **Resets source** (`git checkout -- .`) to remove any previous patches
3. **Applies 6 patches** for HIP 5.7 compatibility (see [HIP57-PATCHES.md](HIP57-PATCHES.md))
4. **Configures CMake** with:
   - `GGML_HIP=ON` — Enable HIP/ROCm backend
   - `AMDGPU_TARGETS=gfx900:xnack+` — Target Vega architecture with xnack page-fault support (required for UMA)
   - `CMAKE_HIP_FLAGS="-mcode-object-version=5"` — Force COv5 (clang-21 defaults to COv6 which HIP 5.7 can't parse)
   - `GGML_HIP_UMA=ON` — Unified Memory Architecture (APU)
   - `LLAMA_BUILD_SERVER=ON` — Build the HTTP server
   - `CMAKE_HIP_COMPILER=/usr/bin/clang++-21`
5. **Builds** with all available CPU cores
6. **Installs** to `llm/rocm-vega/`

### Build Time

On a Ryzen 7 5700G (8 cores / 16 threads):
- First build: ~15-30 minutes (compiling ~150 HIP kernel files)
- Rebuild after source update: Varies (CMake incremental build)

### Rebuilding

The script automatically:
- `git fetch` + `git pull` to get latest llama.cpp
- `git checkout -- .` to reset any previous patches
- Re-applies all patches fresh
- Does a clean build (`rm -rf build`)

Just re-run:

```bash
./build/build-llamacpp-rocm-vega.sh
```

## ROCm 7.2 Build (Default ROCm Path)

ROCm 7.x dropped official gfx900 support, but llama.cpp can still be built and run by backporting `gfx900` tensile GEMM kernels from ROCm 6.3.4. Confirmed working on Vega 8 as of 2026-05-14 (Qwen3.5-35B-A3B-Q4_K_M, 41/41 layers, sustained inference stable).

**Key fix:** `TensileLibrary_lazy_gfx900.dat` must be present — ROCm 7 looks up this lazy index file first at runtime. Without it, inference crashes with `rocBLAS error: Cannot read TensileLibrary.dat: Illegal seek for GPU arch: gfx900`. The Dockerfile multi-stage build installs rocBLAS into a `rocm/dev-ubuntu-22.04:6.3.4` stage and copies the file across.

### The gfx900 kernels, prepackaged

Both build paths below fetch the 6.3.4 kernels on their own, so nothing here needs this.
It exists because the files are useful without the rest of the repo — on a discrete Vega 10,
or in any other ROCm 7 install — and digging them out of AMD's 2024 `.deb` is the step
everyone repeats.

```bash
wget https://github.com/daimonionnn/amd-vega-rocm-vulkan-llm-toolkit/releases/download/rocblas-gfx900-6.3.4/rocblas-gfx900-6.3.4.tar.gz
tar xzf rocblas-gfx900-6.3.4.tar.gz
sudo cp rocblas-gfx900-6.3.4/library/* /opt/rocm/lib/rocblas/library/
ls /opt/rocm/lib/rocblas/library/ | grep -c gfx900     # expect 128
```

The tarball carries a README naming the exact source package and its SHA256, plus
per-file checksums in `MANIFEST.sha256`. Regenerate it with
[`build/package-gfx900-kernels.sh`](../build/package-gfx900-kernels.sh), which downloads
the package from `repo.radeon.com`, verifies it against the repository's `Packages` index,
and fails if `TensileLibrary_lazy_gfx900.dat` is absent — a set without that index file
looks complete and dies at the first GEMM.

**Where it fits:**

| | |
| --- | --- |
| Classic ROCm 7.0–7.2 | ✅ what this is for; tested on 7.2.0 |
| gfx900 (discrete Vega 10) | ✅ no override needed |
| gfx90c (Vega 8 and other APU iGPUs) | ✅ with `HSA_OVERRIDE_GFX_VERSION=9.0.0` |
| AMD modular packages (`amdrocm-core` 7.13+) | ❌ their ROCr rejects the gfx version override |
| ROCm 7.14 | ❌ needs the newer-format Tensile files from AMD's 7.14 gfx900 wheel — see [the 7.14 write-up](../bench/results/2026-09-11-rocm714-working.md) |

### Docker (containerized alternative)

```bash
# Build image (one-time, ~20-40 min — downloads ROCm 6.3.4 rocblas inside)
docker build -t llama-rocm7-vega -f build/Dockerfile.rocm7-vega build/

# Run (auto-detects the Vega 8 render node by PCI ID, ignores the R9700s)
./run/run-docker-rocm7.sh /path/to/model.gguf -ngl 99 -c 2048
```

Key differences from ROCm 6 Docker:
- Based on `rocm/dev-ubuntu-22.04:7.2` (Ubuntu 22.04 + ROCm 7.2)
- No FP8 stub patch needed — ROCm 7 HIP has native FP8 types
- No HIP version-check patch needed — ROCm 7 HIP ≥ 6.1
- Code object version: ROCm 7 LLVM defaults to COv6 which its runtime supports
- Tensile backport: gfx900 `.co` files copied from ROCm 6.3.4 rocBLAS package at build time

### Baremetal (requires classic ROCm 7.0–7.2 on the host)

> ✅ Working on the current host (re-verified 2026-09-07). This path needs **classic**
> ROCm 7.0–7.2. AMD's modular `amdrocm-core` 7.13+/gfx120x packages — installed here
> May–September 2026 for the R9700s — reject `HSA_OVERRIDE_GFX_VERSION` and ship no
> gfx9 rocBLAS kernels; the build and run scripts detect that and abort with a pointer
> to Docker.

#### Baremetal Prerequisites (Ubuntu 25.10 / 26.04)

Neither release is officially supported by AMD, so the installer pins to the
noble (24.04) packages. On 26.04 those still resolve because `libelf1t64` provides
`libelf1` and `libncurses-dev` provides `libtinfo-dev`.

```bash
sudo bash setup/bootstrap-host.sh     # full host prep, calls the installer below
# or just the ROCm part:
sudo bash setup/install-rocm7-host.sh
```

This adds the ROCm 7.2 apt repo pinned to `noble` and installs ~29 packages including
`hip-dev` and `hsa-rocr-dev`.

**libxml2 soname shim — now automatic.** ROCm LLVM's linker (`lld`) was built against
`libxml2.so.2`, but Ubuntu 25.10+ ships only `libxml2.so.16` (soname bumped in libxml2
2.15), and without a shim CMake's HIP compiler test fails. `install-rocm7-host.sh`
creates the symlink itself, inside `/opt/rocm/lib` (and `/opt/rocm/llvm/lib`) rather
than `/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu`, so no system package is affected.

#### Build and Run

```bash
# Build (add --skip-backport on subsequent runs once tensile files are installed)
export PATH=/opt/rocm/bin:$PATH
bash build/build-llamacpp-rocm7-baremetal.sh
bash build/build-llamacpp-rocm7-baremetal.sh --skip-backport  # subsequent runs

# Verify GPU indices (June 2026: R9700s = index 0+1, Vega 8 = index 2)
rocminfo | grep -B2 -A5 'gfx90'

# Run via the wrapper script (auto-detects Vega 8 index)
bash run/run-rocm7-baremetal.sh /path/to/model.gguf -ngl 99 -c 8192

# Or manually:
export ROCR_VISIBLE_DEVICES=2   # Vega 8 GPU index from rocminfo (depends on installed dGPUs)
export HIP_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0    # Relative index within ROCR_VISIBLE_DEVICES mask
export HSA_OVERRIDE_GFX_VERSION=9.0.0
export HSA_ENABLE_SDMA=0
export HSA_XNACK=0              # =1 freezes the whole PC on Vega 8
export GPU_MAX_ALLOC_PERCENT=100
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH="$PWD/llm/rocm7-vega/lib:/opt/rocm/lib"
./llm/rocm7-vega/bin/llama-server -m /path/to/model.gguf -ngl 99
```

> **Confirmed:** Binary detects `AMD Radeon Graphics, gfx900:xnack-` with 65536 MiB VRAM (full 64 GB GTT).

## Running

### Standalone llama-server (Default ROCm 7.2 Baremetal)

```bash
./run/start-llama-server.sh
# Server: http://127.0.0.1:8080/v1
```

The default launcher delegates to `run/run-rocm7-baremetal.sh`, selects the Vega 8 HSA agent, and uses `-fa 0` by default for best ROCm prefill on gfx900.

### Standalone llama-server via Docker (ROCm 6.2.4 legacy)

The host ROCm stack (HIP 5.7.1) crashes on GPU inference. Use the Docker launcher instead:

```bash
./run/run-docker-rocm.sh ~/models/your-model.gguf -ngl 99 -c 2048 --no-warmup
# Auto-builds the Docker image on first run (~10 min)
# Server: http://127.0.0.1:8080/v1
```

See [TROUBLESHOOTING.md](TROUBLESHOOTING.md#docker-rocm-624-workaround-working-legacy-solution) for full details.

### Standalone llama-server (Legacy host ROCm, CPU-only)

```bash
./run/run-llamaserver-rocm.sh ~/models/your-model.gguf -ngl 0
```

This wrapper sets all the required environment variables and launches the server. The API is available at `http://127.0.0.1:8080/v1`.

> **Note:** `-ngl 99` will crash on the Ubuntu-packaged HIP 5.7.1 host stack. For native ROCm GPU offload, use ROCm 7.2 baremetal instead.

### Manual Run

```bash
export HSA_OVERRIDE_GFX_VERSION=9.0.0
export HSA_ENABLE_SDMA=0
export HSA_XNACK=0        # 1 hard-freezes Vega 8 PC
export GGML_HIP_UMA=0     # UMA=1 segfaults when XNACK=0
export GPU_MAX_ALLOC_PERCENT=100

./llm/rocm-vega/bin/llama-server \
    -m ~/models/your-model.gguf \
    -ngl 0 \
    --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8080
```

> Use `-ngl 0` for CPU-only. Any GPU offload (`-ngl 1+`) will segfault on the host (HIP 5.7.1 mismatch). Use `./run/run-docker-rocm.sh` for GPU offload.

### Interactive CLI Chat

```bash
export HSA_OVERRIDE_GFX_VERSION=9.0.0
export HSA_ENABLE_SDMA=0
export HSA_XNACK=0
export GGML_HIP_UMA=0

./llm/rocm-vega/bin/llama-cli \
    -m ~/models/your-model.gguf \
    -ngl 0 \
    -c 4096 \
    --chat-template chatml
```

### Key CLI Options

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `-m PATH` | Path to GGUF model file |
| `-ngl N` | Number of layers to offload to GPU (`99` = all) |
| `-c N` | Context window size (tokens) |
| `--host IP` | Listen address (default: `127.0.0.1`) |
| `--port N` | Listen port (default: `8080`) |
| `-t N` | Number of CPU threads |
| `--chat-template NAME` | Chat template (chatml, llama2, etc.) |

## Connecting to LM Studio

You can run llama-server alongside LM Studio and connect to it as a remote endpoint:

1. Start the server: `./run/start-llama-server.sh`
2. In LM Studio: **Developer → Connect to external endpoint**
3. Enter: `http://127.0.0.1:8080/v1`

## Replacing LM Studio's ROCm Backend (Experimental)

> **Warning:** This may break LM Studio. Back up first.

You will need `patchelf` to fix library paths so the backend can find its dependencies. If you don't have it installed:
```bash
python3 -m pip install --user --break-system-packages patchelf
```

```bash
BACKEND="$HOME/.lmstudio/extensions/backends/llama.cpp-linux-x86_64-amd-rocm-avx2-2.13.0"

# Backup
cp -a "$BACKEND" "$BACKEND.bak"

# Replace libs (including versioned symlinks)
cp -a llm/rocm-vega/lib/libggml*.so* "$BACKEND/"
cp -a llm/rocm-vega/lib/libllama*.so* "$BACKEND/"

# Fix RUNPATH for dependencies so LM Studio's engine can find them
for f in "$BACKEND"/*.so; do
    if [ -f "$f" ] && [ ! -L "$f" ]; then
        ~/.local/bin/patchelf --set-rpath '$ORIGIN' "$f"
    fi
done
```

This is risky due to potential ABI mismatches between our build and LM Studio's engine. The standalone server approach is much safer.

### Troubleshooting: "Exit code: null"
If you load a model in LM Studio and immediately get a silent crash (`Exit code: null`), the ROCm driver sequence is segfaulting because LM Studio did not load with the necessary hardware override variables. 

To fix this, you must **close LM Studio completely** and launch it from a terminal where the environment variables are exported:

```bash
export HSA_OVERRIDE_GFX_VERSION=9.0.0
export HSA_ENABLE_SDMA=0
export HSA_XNACK=0
export GGML_HIP_UMA=0

# Now launch LM Studio from this terminal!
# (e.g. run `lmstudio` or `/path/to/LM_Studio.AppImage`)
```

If it continues to crash even with these variables, rollback the backend to the `.bak` folder and rely on the **Docker standalone server** (Option A) to handle the GPU inference safely.
